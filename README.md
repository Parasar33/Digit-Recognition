## Overview
This digit recognition system utilizes an ANN to classify images of handwritten digits. The primary goal is to provide an accurate and efficient model for recognizing digits in a variety of applications, such as form processing, educational tools, and automation tasks.

The ANN is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled handwritten digit images, making it an ideal starting point for implementing and testing machine learning models.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: The model is optimized for high accuracy on digit classification.
- **Easy to Use**: With a simple interface, users can test the model on their handwritten digit images.
- **Scalable**: The model architecture can be easily modified for larger datasets or additional digit-related tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the model and supporting scripts.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the ANN model.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 testing images

Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, labeled with the correct digit (0–9).

You can download the MNIST dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or use the built-in Keras dataset loader.

## Model Architecture
The ANN model consists of:
1. **Input Layer**: Accepts 28x28 pixel images (flattened to 784 input nodes).
2. **Hidden Layers**: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions for non-linearity.
3. **Output Layer**: 10 nodes, each representing one digit (0–9), with a Softmax activation function to output probabilities.

The model is trained using cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer for efficient convergence.
